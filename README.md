# FinalProjectDigitalPoetry
final project for digital poetry COM369 Spring 2023
 
This is my course project for COM369 at NJIT. It contains all of my necessary html, css, and MP3 files for it to be hosted properly. 
I couldn't get it to load on a website and made the code available for everyone to run should they be interested.
